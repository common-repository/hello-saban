This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation of Alabama football fans.

== Description ==

When activated, your logon page background will be replaced with a night time photo of Bryant-Denny Stadium and the WordPress logo with the Alabama logo. Upon logging in, you will be greeted with a rousing Rammer Jammer and you'll notice quotes from the greatest college football coach alive on your dashboard pages Hello Dolly style.

Props to Jason Stallings and his fun little Air Horn plugin for technique for playing sound on login.
